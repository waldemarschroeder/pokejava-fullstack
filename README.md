# PokeJava - a Full Stack Webapp by Waldemar Schr√∂der
This is my first selfmade Full Stack Webapp: PokeJava <br />
Initially, I wanted to challenge my java skills by building something useful (and maybe gain a job as a java dev). <br />

First, I wanted to build something with JSP, but I didn't get very familiar with JSP. <br />
Then I found java spring boot, I found a good "hello world" base. From that I build the backend of PokeJava. <br />
I installed a java spring boot extension in VS Code, I click on the run button and then I can start the game in the browser on http://localhost:8080/. <br />
The java backend only was boring and then I build the frontend with JS. <br />
Later I found out, that building a frontend is not quite easy. <br />
Maybe I have invested more time in JS than in java... <br />

The game is not finished yet. There are 4 different PokeJavas. There is a big map with a gym and 5 smaller maps. <br />
But the game is playable, the main functions are working. <br />
